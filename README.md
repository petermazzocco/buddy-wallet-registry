# Buddy Wallet Registry

This is an implementation of the ERC6551 registry via Tokenbound for added support for Buddy Wallet dApp.

The main difference between the two registeries is the addition of a mapping to track if an
implementation address has successfully created their account or not.

This added change allows for a decentralized to managing state.
